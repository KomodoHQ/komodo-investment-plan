# Development Team Investment Plan

Welcome to the Komodo Development Team Investment Plan.

## What this plan is...

This plan is an analysis of where we are as a development team and where we should focus our energy, research and investment in over the long term at the company.

Not all of the items in these documents, can, should or will be addressed. Rather, they offer a direction, and may or may not be actioned.

Ultimately, think of these documents as our shining light in the darkness. Its up to us which path we walk, and when.

## What this plan is not...

This plan is not a guarentee of action in all of the areas identified. 

Further, some of the points / changes proposed are already underway within the business (or may be fully implemented).
