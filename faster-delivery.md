# Faster Delivery

_"What are the biggest barriers to faster delivery? How can we deliver faster?"_

- Eliminate interruptions
- Reduce time to review and amend pull requests
- Eliminate time waiting for resources / feedback
- Stop changing tasks and priorities
- Get rid of slow development environments, jumping through hoops, lack of existing documentation
- Understand the problem from the outside
- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Stop creating / maintaining overly-complex engineered systems
- Having to (re)learn systems, especially poorly documented or maintend ones
- Having to (re)learn tools and technologies, particularly old and slow ones, with poor documentation and inconsistant standards
- Worries about breaking other parts of the system
- Scared about breaking production environments, affecting real people
- Give people space to solve a problem, but give them clear avenues to get immediate support
- Empower team to take decisions, not have to wait for them
