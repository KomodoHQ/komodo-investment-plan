# Faster Delivery

_"What are the biggest barriers to faster delivery? How can we deliver faster?"_

## Eliminate Interruptions

### Personal

 - Work from home.
 - DND on slack.

### Business

 - No meeting days.
 - Seperate support from feature development team members. 
 - Dedicate team members as "interruptable" vs "not-interruptable".
 - Dedicated "dont interrupt me" time and office hours - allocated time for interruptions.

### Tool / Product

 - Measure interruptions - Interruption counter? Dash button?. 

## Reduce time to review and amend pull requests

### Personal

 - Reduce the size of PRs
 - Pre-allocated PR review time

### Business

 - Ensure PR is "complete" - checklist of expected content
 - Have a hard limit for the number of "pending" PRs, and once hit, ensure they are reviewed immediately

### Tool / Product

 - Measure time from open PR to review
 - Github tool - Automate elements of PR review - e.g. automate check for README update

## Eliminate time waiting for resources / feedback

### Personal

 - Pre-prepare a list of what resources / feedback is required for each ticket at the start of sprint.

### Business

 - Set deadlines for getting resources / feedback to us. Have a punitive system for handling delays / missing information.
 - Ensure all resources / feedback are in one specific place.

### Tool / Product

 - Measure number of times a task was unable to be started due to missing detail

## Stop changing tasks and priorities

### Personal

 - Refuse to change task without approval by management
 - Do not engage directly with the customer work requests on Slack - forcefully redirect the customer to PM

### Business

 - Prevent customers from being able to mandage changes to task / priority this during a sprint - committed delivery


### Tool / Product

 - Measure how many times priorities / tasks change within a sprint

## Get rid of slow development environments, jumping through hoops, lack of existing documentation

### Personal

 - Make sure environments are 1 line start up 

### Business

 - Allocate time to refactor slow development environments

### Tool / Product

 -
